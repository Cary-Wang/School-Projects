<b>Project Outline:</b> An open-ended personal final project where we were asked to find datasets and utilize the concepts we learned in class to draw out interesting insights. I chose to examine college sexual assault data and attempt to find predictors that lead to higher rates of sexual assaults. All findings can be viewed in the website link above.
