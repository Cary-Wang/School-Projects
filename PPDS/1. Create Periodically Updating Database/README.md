<b>Instructions</b>

1. Identify a web API that returns data that change over time. (Examples: Spotify returns artist popularity, Twitter returns trending topics, NYTimes and Guardian return news headlines, NYC Open Data, etc). You should pick a data source for which historic data are not readily and easily accessible.
2. Create a database and the corresponding set of tables for storing the data, following the paradigm of the Citibike example.
3. Write Python code that connects to the API, fetches the data, and stores them in the database.
4. Create the Python script and schedule it to run periodically using cron.
