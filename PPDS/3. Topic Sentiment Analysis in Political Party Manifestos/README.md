<b>Project Partner:</b> David Wang (Stern '17)

<b>Project Outline:</b> This was an open-ended data analysis project applying concepts learned in class, ranging from natural language processing to sentiment analysis. Given the ongoing political election at the time, my partner and I decided to analyze decades worth of political party manifestos for both the U.S. Republican and Democratic parties. The goal was to complete a comparative analysis of the salient topics and trends of the two dominant political parties.
